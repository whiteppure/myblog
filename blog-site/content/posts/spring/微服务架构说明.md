## 什么是微服务架构？
> In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services,
 each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.
 These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.
 There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies. ——[James Lewis and Martin Fowler (2014)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)

大意：简而言之，微服务体系结构风格是一种将单个应用程序开发为一套小型服务的方法，每个服务运行在自己的进程中，并与轻量级机制(通常是HTTP资源API)通信。
这些服务是围绕业务功能构建的，可以通过全自动部署机制进行独立部署。对这些服务的集中管理是最低限度的，这些服务可能用不同的编程语言编写，并使用不同的数据存储技术。
